# Imagery

Imagery is an important opportunity to communicate who we are, promote our services, make connections and impart knowledge, and BFI point of view. Great images can deepen the attachment to our brand and support people to navigate our site.

We should use full colour images to build empathy, win hearts and minds, communicate complex ideas and support the written word across **archetypes 1 to 4**.

We won’t use images for **archetype 5 - To Get a job Done**, to help a user stay focused with the support of the written word.
