# Colour
BFI uses colours to communicate functionality in the interface and to subtley provide a guide for which area of the website is being viewed. Colour must be used carefully and abiding by a clear set of guidence.

### Colours must always be accessible
When using colours, ensure that they work for everyone, especially those who are colour blind or who have low vision. Do not use color on its own to convey information. The BFI colour palette has been designed with accessibility as a fundamental guiding principle, and so the colour contrast of each colour combination has been taken into account for all shades. 

All colour contrasts of text and interactive elements must meet [level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum).

- To have similar coloured text on coloured background, always use the dark shade on top of light shade of each colour option.
- Black and Deep Navy should be used on Dusty Pink.
- White and Dusty Pink should be used on Deep Navy.
- White and Dusty Pink should be used on Racer Green.
- White and Dusty Pink should be used on Black.
- Black and Deep Navy should be used on Light Grey & White.

### Communication > Aesthetics
While colour adds to the decoration of a web page, it is more important that the colour is used purposefully and should be there to support the content, not replace it. Colour is used to support the organising prinicples of the website, but it is not there as the only means of communicating the organising principles.

### Visual hierarchy with colour use
Colour should be used to help guide a user to what matters on the page, supporting the visual hierarchy of the page. Colour should not be over used.
