## Ways of working

#### 1. The BFI is distinctive 
The BFI holds a unique place in British society as an authority on and supporter of films and filmmaking. This unique place is seen through our technical points of view, the credibility of our opinions, and the general character of the BFI. Our voice is unique from other organisations.

#### 2. The BFI is confident to be challenged and feels comfortable with discomfort
The BFI is confident and comfortable in its identity as an authority on film and filmmaking. This confidence and experience positions us as a credible source for information on film and filmmaking. At the same time, the BFI prides itself on its universality and accessibility.  

#### 3. The BFI embraces failure
The BFI learns by doing. We encourage each other to take risks in our work and embrace the failure that sometimes occurs as a result of taking risks. We learn from those failures and mistakes, and are comfortable with questioning each other. 

#### 4. The BFI is transparent in decision-making
(content to be written)

#### 5. The BFI’s governance should make it easy for people to innovate
The BFI is an organisation that holds itself accountable. We are accountable to abide by the other values and principles we have set out for the bfi.org.uk. We are accountable to our users to provide a pleasant and enjoyable user experience. We are also accountable to our advocates, content creators, developers, managers, and product leads to create an environment where they feel comfortable innovating through our governance structures.

## Visual design 

#### 1. Create engaging experiences 
- Create an enjoyable and delightful experience for users, by being creative in our design choices
- Use a variety of visual layouts to add an element of interest and surprise for the user.

#### 2. Support user goals and reduce cognitive load 
- Design icons that enable the user to distinguish their function and differentiate them from each other. 
- Ensure size, colour and accordance of interaction of objects (how they suggest possible interactions – e.g. a button looks clickable) is appropriate for their use.

#### 3. Comply with accessibility guidelines 
- Ensure there is enough contrast between text and backgrounds.
- Where possible, don’t use colour alone to indicate an action or difference.
- Ensure all text is readable, with effective use of font size, kerning and line spacing.

#### 4. Be consistent with visual language 
- Facilitate an easy to understand experience, by creating a visual language that is recognisable to users across the site.

#### 5. Create repeatable, re-usable and scalable visual assets 
- Where possible, avoid creating bespoke, one-time use elements

## Communication & content design 
#### 1. Put the user at the heart of our content.
- Make sure BFI content across digital and non-digital channels is designed to meet user needs and supports the best possible user experience. 
- Always create content with a purpose. Consider the content archetypes – do we want to sell, to inspire or to inform? Prioritise a purpose. 
- Use research insights and data to inform and back up content decisions.

#### 2. Assume an interest in film, but no particular knowledge.
- Never assume prior knowledge of our audience. 
- Be inclusive with the language and formats we use. 
- Explain terminology and avoid jargon. 

#### 3. Communicate in a simple, easy-to-digest way. 
- Make it effortless to read and make decisions. 
- Use plain language and short sentences to make content easy and quick to scan. 
- Use language our users use.

#### 4. Don’t overwhelm users with too many options
- BFI offers a lot of recommendations for people. From films to watch and articles to read, to services to choose from. Focus on quality over quantity. 
- Organise and prioritise recommendations based on user needs. 

#### 5. Allow space for individual opinion and communication style
- The user experience should be consistent, but not uniform. 
- Authors and content designers should have the flexibility to communicate in different styles based on the content type and the user need.

#### 6. Give users a clear pathway to move on and come back. 
- Support users to experience BFI across time using multiple touchpoints. 
- Always be clear about what users can do and provide relevant calls to action. 
- Do not leave users with a dead-end.
