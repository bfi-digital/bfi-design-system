# Hero video use
### Landing page hero video 
Short videos can be added into the hero of a landing page however there are a set of guidelines to follow in order to use this feature. 

The video should:
* be no larger than 16mb - ideally be as small as possible 
* not have any sound (it will be muted if it has sound)
* not have any text or information a user can get only from the video and not on the page - due to accessibility reasons
* be no longer than 10 seconds 
* the video is set to auto loop, so it should either be set to loop so that content can be seamless, or set to fade to black at the end so that there is not an abrupt cut.
not be used to showcase trailers or long video content as that should be on the page.
* 16:9 ratio
* mp4 and/or webm format.
 
To add a video:
* An image still from the video is required to be uploaded so that it can be displayed as the feature image of the page, it will display while the video loads or if there are issues playing the video. A landing page content type cannot be saved if an image is not present. 
* A mp4 version of the video must be uploaded, a webm version can also be added. Webm can be smaller than mp4, but is less well used (which is why mp4 is required) so if you add the webm it will supersede the mp4 and be quicker, it also provides the browser an alternative if there is an issue accessing one of them / or the browser may not support it.
* Display text can be overlaid on the hero video on the page or removed same as the image guidance.
