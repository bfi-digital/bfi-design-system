# Image sizing

There are a number of different ways images can be used on [bfi.org.uk](www.bfi.org.uk). Below are the different specs required for each image type. 

## Hero images
These are the main images of the page, they appear at the top of the page but their display varies between content types.

### Landing page  
* 16:9 
* Minimum of 1920x1080px with a safe area of 60px at the top and 90px at the side
* jpg 
* Max 16MB, but should be saved as small as possible as large files will affect page loading
* The vertical focus of the image should be in the centre as much as possible, this is because depending on the screen size the image can be cropped vertically. The horizontal focus should either be in the center or to the right if the title is included, as it sits on the left.
* The top of image should not be too busy since the BFI logo and site’s navigation will be displayed in overlay
* Avoid any text in the image since screen readers can’t pick it up, any text that is included in the image, should also be added as alt-text word for word. 
* On mobile devices if a title is included the aspect ratio can change as the title makes the hero taller, in this case some of the sides of the image may be cropped.

### Service list and Page 
* 16x9 ratio 
* Minimum of 1920x1080 px with a safe area of 60px at the top and 90px at the side
* jpg 
* Max 16MB, but should be saved as small as possible as large files will affect page loading
* These heros won't crop in the same way as the langing page hero, they will retain their 16:9 ratio on mobile and display the whole image. 

### Show page
* 16x9 ratio 
* Minimum of 1920x1080 px with a safe area of 60px at the top and 90px at the side
* jpg 
* Max 16MB, but should be saved as small as possible as large files will affect page loading
* These heros won't crop in the same way as the langing page hero, they will retain their 16:9 ratio on mobile and display the whole image. 

## Component images
Images that feature as part of a component on a page 

### Page links
* 16x9 
* Minimum of 960x540 px with a safe area of 60px at the top and 90px at the side
* jpg 
* Max 16MB, but should be saved as small as possible as large files will affect page loading

### Promo banners
* 16x9 
* Minimum of 1500x844 with a safe area of 60px at the top and 90px at the side
* Max 16MB, but should be saved as small as possible as large files will affect page loading
* The image might be resized according to the length of the text in the promo block and the device of the user. This is due to the nature of this component being set as a proportion of the screen size. Aim to have the main focus of the image in the centre in case of cropping. 

### Logo links
* A logo image should be sized at 200 high x required width, the component will suppress the size to 100px high and the required width. 
* This allows the links to sit together in a line regardless of the logo aspect ratio, allowing square and rectangular logos to be similar sizes. 
* Be careful with the images you upload, if there is more than one ensure that they have the same amount of padding within the image, otherwise they will come out different sizes visually. (many logos come with a preset padding, which can be different)

### Banner 
* Minimum of 1440x66 px 
* jpg
* Max 16MB, but should be saved as small as possible as large files will affect page loading
* Avoid too much text since this can be very small on mobile so it might be difficult to read 
* Important text should be on the left side since cropping happens predominantly from the right
* Any design should be on black background
