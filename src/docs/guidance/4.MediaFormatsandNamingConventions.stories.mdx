# Media formats and naming conventions

General note about versions

The CMS won’t allow uploads to have the same filename. If you have to overwrite an existing version of the same image or file, add -v2, -v3, etc to the end of the filename.

Example:
* bfi-press-release-sight-and-sound-poll-winners-2022-08-07-v2.pdf 

## Images

Photographic images, including modern location shots, scans of printed documents and BFI Special Collections:

* film-name-year-descriptive-detail.jpg
* person-name-film-year-descriptive-detail.jpg
* person-name-descriptive-detail.jpg
* location-film-name-year-descriptive-detail
* event-year-descriptive-detail.jpg
* BFI-special-collections-film-name-year-descriptive-detail.jpg

Notes:

* Separate elements with hyphens, not spaces or underscores
* Save as JPEG at the original size and highest JPEG quality. The CMS will scale images for size and quality in different contexts.
* It’s important that the title and year are accurate. The descriptive text is more free-form. 
* Describe the image in the descriptive text – don't use character or actor names unless they’re universally known.

Changes to the current convention:

* Don't include the image dimensions
* Don't number the images
* Don't include a BFI database reference

## Documents

* bfi-document-type-document-name-yyyy-mm-dd.pdf

Notes:

* Separate elements with hyphens, not spaces or underscores
* Save as PDF, Word or Excel.
* Always include BFI at the beginning – this document will be downloaded and lose the context of being published on bfi.org.uk.
* If there’s no day or month, leave them off. Always include a year, even if it’s just the year you’re publishing the document.

Changes to the current convention:

* Don't number document versions.

Examples:

1. bfi-press-release-sight-and-sound-poll-winners-2022-08-07.pdf
2. bfi-uk-box-office-q1-2020.pdf
3. bfi-british-film-other-screen-sectors-certification-full-year-2019.pdf

## Logos, artwork and graphics

* organisation-name-descriptive-detail-logo-widthxheight.png

Notes:

* Separate elements with hyphens, not spaces or underscores
* Use PNG where possible. JPEG should be used for photographic or complex graded images.

Examples:

* bfi-japan-2020-artwork-godzilla-1954-1000x750.png
* bfi-player-roku-promo-theorem-1968-300x400.jpg
