# Accessibility

A core principle of [bfi.org.uk](www.bfi.org.uk) is to create products that are accessible to as many users as possble. We strive to meet [WCAG 2.2 AA standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) of accessibility in all areas of the proudct. 

There are a number of factors that should be considered when creating and uploading content to the BFI website. If content is supplied that does not meet these criteria then it should not be published on the website and explained to the submitting persons why. If there are circumstances that prevent the content from meeting these criteria then alternatives can be looked at. 

More in depth information can be foun from the following resources:
* [WCAG 2.2 accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) 
* [W3C accessibility tutorials](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/)
* [GOV.UK WCAG 2.1 primer guidelines](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/content.html#content-related-wcag-2-1-a-and-aa-success-criteria) 

## Text and page structure
#### 1. Page title
Each page must have a unique title that indicates its topic or purpose. This ensures that people with cognitive disabilities can quickly orientate themselves within the service and identify the purpose of the page without interpreting its entire contents.

#### 2. Heading structure
Content should be structured by means of headings 1 to 4. The choice of heading level is made according to its position in the hierarchy. It is important to be consistent when using headings and sub-headings, and not skip a heading level in the hierarchy (i.e. go straight from a Heading 2 to a Heading 4). 

Headings must only be used to identify headings, do not use them to enlarge text.

#### 3. Text justification
Centre text justification can make it difficult for some users to read, particularly those with dyslexia. All headings and body text should be left-aligned where possible, centre-alignment for shorter titles can be used e.g. articles.

#### 4. Multiple line breaks
As a general rule, multiple line breaks used to add space between two content items should be avoided. They are likely to cause issues for screen reader users, the line breaks that are created by the CMS should be enough. If more space is needed between content items a divider component can be used. 

#### 5. Write unique and explicit text links
The text link is the text of the hyperlink displayed on the screen. As far as possible, the text of a link should describe exactly where it goes in unambiguous terms. Use clear and explicit link texts that can be understood when read without the text that surrounds them.
A link such as “Click here” is therefore to be avoided for more informative links such as “BFI cultural fund statement” or “More about our membership offer”.

Multiple links that point to the same destination should have the same link text e.g. Sign up to 25 & under. 

#### 6. Consistent identification
When features with the same functionality are used in multiple places, they must be identified in a consistent way. This helps screen reader users correctly identify the type and purpose of the functionality.
* An icon has the same alternative text wherever it is used;
* Buttons for “Next”, “Previous”, and “Continue”, are labelled consistently wherever they are used;
* Form fields with the same purpose are consistently labelled wherever they are used.

#### 7. Use bulleted and numbered lists correctly
When bulleted and numbered lists are included in the content, use the appropriate tools in the publishing software for this, rather than entering dashes or numbers from the keyboard.

Use a numbered list when the order of items is important, in other words the information will not be understood if the items are written in a different order (steps to complete a transaction etc.). 

Use a standard bulleted list when the order of items is unimportant.
