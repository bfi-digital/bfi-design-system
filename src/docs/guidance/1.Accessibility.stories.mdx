# Accessibility

A core principle of [bfi.org.uk](www.bfi.org.uk) is to create products that are accessible to as many users as possble. We strive to meet [WCAG 2.2 AA standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) of accessibility in all areas of the proudct. 

There are a number of factors that should be considered when creating and uploading content to the BFI website. If content is supplied that does not meet these criteria then it should not be published on the website and explained to the submitting persons why. If there are circumstances that prevent the content from meeting these criteria then alternatives can be looked at. 

More in depth information can be foun from the following resources:
* [WCAG 2.2 accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) 
* [W3C accessibility tutorials](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/)
* [GOV.UK WCAG 2.1 primer guidelines](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/content.html#content-related-wcag-2-1-a-and-aa-success-criteria) 

## Text and page structure
#### 1. Page title
Each page must have a unique title that indicates its topic or purpose. This ensures that people with cognitive disabilities can quickly orientate themselves within the service and identify the purpose of the page without interpreting its entire contents.

**Useful resource**: [How to write better page titles](https://www.nomensa.com/blog/2013/how-to-write-better-page-titles)

#### 2. Heading structure
Content should be structured by means of headings 1 to 4. The choice of heading level is made according to its position in the hierarchy. It is important to be consistent when using headings and sub-headings, and not skip a heading level in the hierarchy (i.e. go straight from a Heading 2 to a Heading 4). 

Headings must only be used to identify headings, do not use them to enlarge text.

**Useful resource**: [Web accessibility tutorials: Headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/)

#### 3. Text justification
Centre text justification can make it difficult for some users to read, particularly those with dyslexia. All headings and body text should be left-aligned where possible, centre-alignment for shorter titles can be used e.g. articles.

#### 4. Multiple line breaks
As a general rule, multiple line breaks used to add space between two content items should be avoided. They are likely to cause issues for screen reader users, the line breaks that are created by the CMS should be enough. If more space is needed between content items a divider component can be used. 

#### 5. Write unique and explicit text links
The text link is the text of the hyperlink displayed on the screen. As far as possible, the text of a link should describe exactly where it goes in unambiguous terms. Use clear and explicit link texts that can be understood when read without the text that surrounds them.
A link such as “Click here” is therefore to be avoided for more informative links such as “BFI cultural fund statement” or “More about our membership offer”.

Multiple links that point to the same destination should have the same link text e.g. Sign up to 25 & under. 

#### 6. Consistent identification
When features with the same functionality are used in multiple places, they must be identified in a consistent way. This helps screen reader users correctly identify the type and purpose of the functionality.
* An icon has the same alternative text wherever it is used;
* Buttons for “Next”, “Previous”, and “Continue”, are labelled consistently wherever they are used;
* Form fields with the same purpose are consistently labelled wherever they are used.

#### 7. Use bulleted and numbered lists correctly
When bulleted and numbered lists are included in the content, use the appropriate tools in the publishing software for this, rather than entering dashes or numbers from the keyboard.

Use a numbered list when the order of items is important, in other words the information will not be understood if the items are written in a different order (steps to complete a transaction etc.). 

Use a standard bulleted list when the order of items is unimportant.

## Images
#### 1. Images of text
Text should not be presented inside of an image as much as possible as it cannot be resized, and it deteriorates in quality when magnified. Not including text in an image means that everyone is able to read and access information presented in text. If text must be included then alternative text should contain the same words as in the image. 

#### 2. Alternative text
Alternative text may be needed on some images. This text is essential for users with low vision using screen readers as it will be read instead of the images that cannot be viewed. This text is also displayed when the images cannot be loaded. 

The content of the alternative text depends on the purpose of the image, i.e. on whether the image is decorative or informative. 

To help you decide if an alternative text is needed, ask yourself if the absence of any text would affect your understanding of the content? If the answer is “yes”, then you need to enter an alternative text; if not, you can leave the alternative text field empty.

#### 2.1 Decorative/illustrative images: 
For decorative or illustrative images do not write an alternative text. Decorative images don’t add information to the content of a page. For example, the information provided by the image might already be given using adjacent text, or the image might be included to make the page more visually attractive.

Whether to treat an image as decorative or informative is a judgment that only the author can make, based on the reason for including the image on the page.

Example: Image of a film still in an article, the image is decorative as the article should be able to be read without needing to see the image to understand the content. 

**Useful resource**: [Web accessibility tutorials: Decorative images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/)

#### 2.2 Informative images
If a user cannot see the image, what information would they need to understand the content the image is conveying? Alternative text should be clear and concise, it should convey the meaning or content that is displayed visually, which typically isn’t a literal description of the image.

In some situations a detailed literal description may be needed, but only when the content of the image is all or part of the conveyed information.

If an image is placed next to the text. All the information in the image is also included in the text besides it. If this image is absent, no information is lost.

Example: using a logo as an image on  page would require alternative text stating the name of the company and that it’s a logo. E.g. American Express logo.

**Useful resource**: [Web accessibility tutorial: Informative images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/)

#### 2.3 Functional Images
Functional images are used to initiate actions rather than to convey information. They are used in buttons, links, and other interactive elements. The text alternative for the image should convey the action that will be initiated (the purpose of the image), rather than a description of the image.
Example: the BFI logo in the top navigation, the text alternative should be ‘BFI home’ as this is the action instead of simply ‘BFI logo’. 

**Useful resource**: [Web accessibility tutorial: Functional images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/)

#### 2.4 Complex informative images
Complex images contain substantial information – more than can be conveyed in a short phrase or sentence. These are typically:
* graphs and charts, including flow charts and organizational charts;
* diagrams and illustrations where the page text relies on the user being able to understand the image;
* maps showing locations or other information such as weather systems.

For this type of image, you need to write: 
* A short alternative text to describe the purpose of the image and, where appropriate, indicate the location of the long description. 
* A detailed description under the image or on another page, a textual representation of the essential information conveyed by the image.

## Moving images
#### 1. Pause moving content. 
It must be possible for users to pause, stop or hide content when content moves (is animated, blinks or scrolls) automatically for more than five seconds, or when content automatically updates on the page. This ensures that people with cognitive disabilities that affect focus and concentration, are not distracted by movement.

#### 2. Three flashes or below
A page must not contain content that flashes more than three times a second. This ensures that people with conditions like photosensitive Epilepsy are protected from harmful seizures.

## Video and audio

#### 1. Audio only and video only 
All content that is audio-only like a podcast, must have a text description that includes all spoken dialogue and sound effects. 

All content that is video-only like a silent film, must have a text description describes the video or an audio description. 

This ensures that information communicated for sight and sound is available to people who cannot see or hear.

#### 2. Closed captions
Video content like instructional videos, promotions and interviews, must have captions that are synchronised with the audio content of the video. This includes all the spoken dialogue and important sound effects from the audio part of the video. 

This ensures that the information communicated by the audio part of the video is available to people who cannot hear it.

#### 3. Captions (live)
Live broadcast video must have captions that are synchronised with the audio content of the video. This ensures that the information communicated by the audio part of the video is available to people who cannot hear it.

## Sensory characteristics
  
#### 1. Directions by characteristic
Do not refer to an item by indicating its color, shape, or position alone. This ensures that instructions can be understood by users who are unable to see or recognise information communicated using sensory characteristics. Examples of what not to do:
* An instruction tells users to ‘Click the green button’; Should tell users to ‘Press the Next button’
* An instruction tells users to ‘use the menu on the left of the page’; it should tell users to ‘use the menu titled More information’
* An instruction tells users they can “find more information in the square box”; it should tell users to ‘find more information in the area titled Supporting information’. 

#### 2. Information by colour
Do not use color as the sole differentiator of information in content. This applies to text, and images, and rich content. For example, a chart might show different data segments using coloured lines. However, changing the lines’ thickness or making them dotted or dashed would also help convey the information in a way that doesn’t rely on the user having to discern the colours. 

## Understandable content
You have to make sure people can understand your content and how the service works.

This means you need to do things like:
* use plain English
* keep sentences short
* not use words and phrases that people won’t recognise - or provide an explanation if you can’t avoid it
* explain all abbreviations and acronyms, unless they are well known and in common use - for example UK, EU, VAT
* make it clear what language the content is written in, and indicate if this changes
* make sure features look consistent and behave in predictable ways
