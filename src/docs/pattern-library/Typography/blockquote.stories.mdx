# Blockquote
 
Blockquotes are used to emphasize excerpts of text. Generally users almost never read a full post, but tend to scan. Therefore we need to provide them with some focus anchors to fix their attention to the most important parts of our articles. Quotes should be used to cite something someone has said, or they could be used to highlight a particular piece of text.
