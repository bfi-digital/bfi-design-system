# Article Hero 

This hero is used on all articles within the BFI site. It is designed differently to the rest of the site to distinguish the users journey and highlight that they are currently reading an article. Therefore this hero has a different emphasis, it is centred, unlike any other hero within the site, with a focus on reading the title and summary of the article first and foremaost, with the featured image coming secondary. Alongside this difference there is also additional information such as a link to the article category tag, the date the article was last updated and a list of any and all authors of the article (thy dont have to include an author as in [this example](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-article--recommends-example-no-author)). 

## Featured image

The article includes a stand out full width featured image. This stands out particularly when compared to the body of the article which can be narrower with a sidebar. As can be seen in the [primary example](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-article--feature-example). The image will also be used as a share image in the meta data for the page.

The image is optional and can not be included where not needed, for example in a list where one image may not clearly show the content of the page. [See this example](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-article--list-example).

## Articles with updated dates

There is an indicator to users if the article has been updated since it was first published [in this example](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-article--feature-example-updated-date) - we only display the updated date on the hero as that is the most important thing fo the user in this case, however the original published date is also added to the bottom of the article content so that there is context for the user.

## Article brand

Articles can be branded within the CMS. If they are added to a brand they become part of this collection and are stored within that brands URL. They are also given a logo to clearly show the brand as in [this example without an image](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-article--recommends-example), or [this example with a featured image](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-article--sight-sound-feature-example)
