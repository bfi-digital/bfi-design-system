# Breadcrumbs
 
A breadcrumb will automatically be displayed at the top of each page. This will be based off of the pages location in the menu. 

The breadcrumbs helps users to understand where they are within a websiteâ€™s structure as they move between levels and pillars. Breadcrumbs are only showed from the 2nd level of child pages onwards and are shown above all content on a page, but below a hero if there is one.

They include a non linked version of the current page the user is on.

## Examples

<Preview>
    <Story name="Normal">
        <Breadcrumbs breadcrumbs={data} />
    </Story>
</Preview>

Breadcrumbs are limited to 8 columns of width on larger screens or 70% of the width of the container. If they are long like in the example below they do not ever fill the full width of the container - this is so they are lower in the visual hierarchy than the content immediately below them, on smaller screen sizes they fill the width.

<Preview>
    <Story name="Long data">
        <Breadcrumbs breadcrumbs={data2} />
    </Story>
