# Breadcrumbs
 
A breadcrumb will automatically be displayed at the top of each page, this will be defined off of the pages location in the menu within the CMS. They will only be displayed on pages that are at least two levels deep in the information architecture of the website. The reason for this is that the first level can easily be seen by the user as it has an underline in the top level navigation and it is also reflected in the title on the page. 

The breadcrumbs helps users to understand where they are within a websiteâ€™s structure as they move between levels and pillars. They include a non linked version of the current page the user is on to help provide context to the user.

On mobile devices the breadcrumbs collapse down to link only to the previous page.

## Examples

    <Story name="Normal">
        <Breadcrumbs breadcrumbs={data} />
    </Story>

Breadcrumbs are limited to 8 columns of width on larger screens or 70% of the width of the container. If they are long like in the example below they do not ever fill the full width of the container - this is so they are lower in the visual hierarchy than the content immediately below them, on smaller screen sizes they fill the width.
