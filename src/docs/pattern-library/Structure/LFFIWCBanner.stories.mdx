# IWC Banner

This unique component was created specifically for the London Film Festival in 2020. 

All previous LFF microsites had included a countdown to the festival with the sponsor IWC Schaffhausen. 

This countdown has been rewritten into a new React component, this slice has been limited to landing page templates in the CMS as it should only be used on something like the LFF landing page. 

The countdown includes a customised date, which once it has completed will be hidden and just replaced with the IWC sonsor logo. 

Alongside this component is a section with a lead paragraph and a call to action. The goal of this is to provide a clear opening to the festival which can lead users directly to the most important piece of infromation, such as the programme. It allows the IWC to stand in a primary location on the page without it having to break the flow of the grid.
