# Hero Page

This hero is specifically used on Service List pages. These pages are used as a centre point for a service and provide links out to other information or lists of possible service offers. This hero is used to help this pivotal pages stand out.

## Service List Pages without images

The featured image is optional, if it is not included the hero will display as a full width banner containing the title and the page summary text with a light coloured background - [see this example](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-page--page-example-without-image). This helps the user understand what the page/service is and especially works well when the service may need to list out a variety of links. 

## Service List Pages with images

If an image is included the design of the hero changes slightly. In order to differentiate this page from something as stricking as a landing page hero with its large full width image, the image is therefore smaller and placed alongside the title and page summary. it retains the same background colour, however this just stands to highlight the image rather than fill the page as it does without an image. [See this example](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-page--page-example-with-image)

The image can also have a credit or caption added to it which will include an accessible title tool tip as [seen here](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-page--page-example-with-image-and-credit).
