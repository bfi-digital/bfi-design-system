# ArticleKeywords

Articles can contain keywords - these are simply tags that help users navigate similar content. These keywords are a secondary tagging system to the primary categories that articles can fall under. They should be used to define what kind of content this article contains. 

The keywords link to a filtered list of articles that also have the same keyword. They are shown at the bottom of an article.
