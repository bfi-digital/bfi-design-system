# Header
 
The header is the primary navigation for the website, it serves to shows users that they are on BFI.org and which section of the website they are currently using. The three top level pillars are focused on being arranged by user goal, a section for users wanting to watch or read about film, a section for industry and funding and a section for learning and training. The aim of these is to provide a quick and simple way for the user to filter down their goal as effieciently as possible to find what they are looking for.

Under each pillar there is a submenu containing all the 2nd level children of this section of content. The submenu adapts dynamically to the number of links that it is provided, on desktop screen sizes it creates a three pillar list of links evenly sorting the number of links provided into a division of three.

The header also includes promotional sections - one allowing for 1/2 links to be seen at all times and another at the bottom of each sub menu. The goal of these is to highlight the main business goals of BFI and encourage users to access the core business areas - Southbank, Player & Membership. These can be updated throughout the year to reflect the changing business goals.

The header has two main states, by default it is oqaque with a white background. However on pages that contain a primary full width hero, the header is set to a transparent background with white text, and is overlaid on top of the hero. On scroll the header sticks to the top of the screen converting into a smaller strip across the top of the page.

The header is fully accessible and includes a hidden 'skip to main content' button that allows users navigating with a keyboard to skip the menu section on every page.
