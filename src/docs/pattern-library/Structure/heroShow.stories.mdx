# Hero Show

This hero is used specifically for Show pages. These are either single film showings or events, or a series of showings or events.

If a show has a single showing it is important for the user to have access instantly to the call to action for that showing - to a user they see this page as a page dedicated to that single instance of the show, rather than a page about the film/event. Therefore the call to action should be included as a child element of the hero component - this will automatically be applied within the BFI CMS. See [this example](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-show--film-with-1-performance-specific-time)

If a show has multiple different times for its showings, this space for a CTA is used to display a link to send the user down the page to the list of showings - this is automatically generated based on the information provided to the page template, [see this example](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-show--film-with-multi-performances-and-credit).

A show can also have a video used to replace the featured image, this can be used to move something important like the trailer of the film up to the top section using a YouTube embed. See [this example](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-hero-show--film-with-multi-performances-and-video).
