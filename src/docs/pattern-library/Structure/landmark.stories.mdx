# Landmark

The Landmark component represents a high-level structural component of the page, usually the Main content section,
but it could also be used as the main page header or footer.

Landmark will fill 100% of the screen width and so can have a background colour applied to fill the whole
screen width with that colour. Its direct children will have their box size set to the bleed width and their
content padding set to the content width. This means any element direct child of the Landmark will automatically
have the correct width sizes without any extra CSS being needed.

The landmark will be rendered as a `main` element by default, but this can be changed using the `as` attribute,
e.g `<Landmark as="footer">...</Landmark>`.

Semantically, any direct children of Landmark should be a sectioning or heading element like article, aside,
nav, section, or header.
