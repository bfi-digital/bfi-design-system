# Filter Links
 
This component is used at the top of an article listing page, it allows users to quickly filter the list of articles to a specific category. We only allow the user to filter a single category at once, and it should not display a filter link if there are not any articles to be found under that filter.

## Examples

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Normal">
        <FilterLinks
            links={[
                {
                    url: "#1",
                    label: "All"
                },
                {
                    url: "#2",
                    label: "Where to stream"
                },
                {
                    url: "#3",
                    label: "Where to begin"
                },
                {
                    url: "#4",
                    label: "Five Things"
                }
            ]}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>
