# Footer

BFI's footer plays an important role in the new and simplfied Information Architecture. The footer provides a space for the more business facing sections of the website, allowing the primary navigation to focus explicitly on the three user groups most likely to have use of BFI's services. Each additional list of links consists of a section of the IA - a parent page with all its children, all of which link to dedicated pages.

Alongside this space for additional section links the footer includes a section dedicated to the companies that support the BFI and links to social media accounts. 

Finally the copyright and important other links are provided at the bottom allowing for users learned behaviour of website design to find things like privacy policies & accessibility information.
