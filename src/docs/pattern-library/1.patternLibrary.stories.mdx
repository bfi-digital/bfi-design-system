# The Pattern Library

The pattern library contains all of the avaliable React components that can be utilised when creating BFI themed pages and sites.

These components are split in to distinct categories:

1. [Structure](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-1-structure-1-structure-index--page) - these components are all about how a page is created, they form the base framework of all the different page templates avaliable within bfi.org
2. [Typography](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-2-typography-1-typography-index--page) - these are any components that related specifically to typography
3. [Elements](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-3-elements-1-elements-index--page) - these are distinct, small and reusable elements 
4. [Slices](/?path=/story/2-pattern-library-4-slices-1-slices-index--page) - by far the largest, the slices are all the avaliable components that a content editor can utilise within the backend CMS of bfi.org to create and design a page
